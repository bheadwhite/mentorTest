4. What is z-index (CSS property) useful for?

    On positioned elements you can regulate a stack order, elements with a higher stack order number are placed in front of other elements with a lesser value using z-index.

5. Summarize what the keyword 'this' is used for?

7. What is a closure and why is it useful?

    A closure is a construct that has an environment of its own where private variables inside persist.
    Because the variables are private, there are usually publicly accessible methods inside the closure to manipulate that data.
    Closures can help us keep that data secure, like classes we can also use closures as templates to create multiple instances of that starting data.

8. How does a prototype work?

    A prototype is basically a reference on a datatype that can be pointed to from all future instances improving memory conservation.

9. Describe what a component-based framework/library is?

    A Component-based framework/library can use and reuse components to build something. In react you usually have one main app component that renders
    other children components and then those children can in turn render other components creating a tree like organization of pieces that make it easy
    for you to see how all the components interact with each other.

10. What is the component lifecycle in React?

    Each component goes through a phase of events creating a lifecycle, where in each phase you can update the client or state using methods of that phase. The phases run from mounting, to updating, and then to unmounting creating a lifecycle.
